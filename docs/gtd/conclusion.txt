Getting Things Done is fundamentally a system for achieving "mind like water"—a state of relaxed clarity where you can fully engage with present work without anxiety about forgotten commitments. The methodology succeeds through comprehensive capture, clear decision-making, systematic organization, and consistent review. When implemented fully, GTD transforms productivity from a source of stress into a source of confidence.

The critical success factor is building and maintaining trust in your system through weekly reviews and complete capture. Without trust, GTD cannot work—your mind will revert to tracking commitments mentally, reintroducing the very overwhelm the system aims to eliminate.

For software implementations, the goal should be enabling these core practices with minimal friction: make capture effortless, clarification clear, organization intuitive, review straightforward, and engagement confident. Complex features matter less than reliable execution of core workflow. Simple systems used consistently will always beat sophisticated systems that are abandoned.

The promise of GTD remains as relevant today as when David Allen published the methodology: you can feel good about what you're not doing only when you know what you're not doing. Complete capture and trusted systems make that possible.
